👋 Hi, I’m Serj Hunt

I'm a product guy, Co-Founder at [Chipp.ai](https://chipp.ai/), Founder CEO at [City as a School](Cityasachool.com). I'm currently designing and develoing EEG based applications for supporting deep concentration in meditation. I'm also an associate at [Jearni](https://jearni.co/) where my research is focused on human agency, self directed learning and humane technology.

I've been involved in the Humane tech movement as part of the founding team at the [Meaning Alignement Institute](https://www.meaningalignment.org/)
