ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Serj Hunt

I'm a learning experience designer (UX / LXD), and associate at [Jearni](https://jearni.co/). My research is focused on learner agency, self directed learning [[Learning power]] and humane technology through a 4E cognitive science lens.

I facilitate design sprints for progressive public schools in the U.S, Uni's in U.K and have supported SME's with instructional design (ID) and educational content creation

I've been involved in the Humane tech movement as part of the founding team at [Human Systems](https://human-systems.org/) and now apply their methodology to education / learning.

I also run an online community exploring the intersection of Tools for Thought and Pedagogy at [Paideia X Praxis](https://paideiaxpraxis.com/)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, Python 3 and NLP
